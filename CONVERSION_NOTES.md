# TypeScript to JavaScript Conversion

This project has been successfully converted from TypeScript to JavaScript.

## Changes Made

### File Extensions
- All `.ts` files converted to `.js`
- All `.tsx` files converted to `.jsx`

### Type Removals
- Removed all TypeScript type annotations
- Removed `interface` and `type` declarations
- Removed generic type parameters (e.g., `<T>`)
- Removed `as` type assertions
- Removed `type` imports (e.g., `import type { Task }`)

### Key Conversions

#### Redux Store (`lib/store.js`)
- Removed `RootState` and `AppDispatch` type exports
- Simplified to plain JavaScript

#### Redux Slices (`lib/slices/`)
- Removed `PayloadAction` type parameters
- Removed interface definitions for state
- Kept all reducer logic intact

#### API Routes (`app/api/`)
- Removed `NextRequest` and `NextResponse` type annotations
- Kept all route handler logic
- Removed `Promise<{ id: string }>` type annotations

#### Components
- Removed prop interface definitions
- Removed component type annotations
- Kept all JSX and logic intact

#### Hooks (`hooks/`)
- Removed type parameters from Redux hooks
- Removed `Task` type imports
- Kept all hook logic

### What Stayed the Same
- All functionality remains identical
- All business logic preserved
- All styling and UI components unchanged
- All API endpoints work the same way
- All state management logic intact

## Running the Project

The project runs exactly the same as before:

\`\`\`bash
npm install
npm run dev
\`\`\`

## Notes
- The project still uses Zod for runtime validation
- Redux Toolkit still provides type safety at runtime
- All features work identically to the TypeScript version
- The codebase is now lighter and faster to parse
